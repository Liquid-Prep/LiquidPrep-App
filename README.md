Liquid Prep App is an user interface that is accessed on your mobile device to get water advise for the selected crop. It is a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) developed with [Angular](https://angular.io/) web framework.

The Liquid Prep App gets the Weather and Crops data from the [Liquid Prep Backend](https://github.com/Liquid-Prep/LiquidPrep-Backend) service and the soil moisture data from the [Liquid Prep Hardware](https://github.com/Liquid-Prep/LiquidPrep-Hardware). After analysis of the weather, crop and soil moisture data the app computes and provides water advise for the selected crop.

The Liquid Prep App can be run on your local machine for development and testing purpose. And it is deployed on [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/cloud/object-storage) for production to be accessed globally.
